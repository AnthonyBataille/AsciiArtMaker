# AsciiArtMaker
Ascii art is a kind of image representation where pixels are replaced by ASCII characters.
This program takes as input the path of a bitmap file (typically 100 x 100 pixels) and draws a ascii art form of the image in standard output.
The goal of this little project was to make a lightweight program with minimal features.

## Compiling
`gcc -Os -o ascii_art_maker main.c`
